  Portfolio Site
</h1>

## Welcome

This is my personal portfolio site. Here you can get to know me a little better, see which technologies I use, and view some of my projects. 

## Tech used to build this site

This site was created with Gatsby, which is a React-based open source framework great for static sites.

I've used Netlify to deploy my site and handle forms. For styling I've used SASS, fontawesome for React and React Reveal. 

## Installation 

To run the project in a development environment, download the source files and `run npm install` to install all dependencies. The run `gatsby develop` to start the project up in development mode.
